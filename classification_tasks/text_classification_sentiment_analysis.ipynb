His signature climax has the entire cast of the film coming together and fighting each other in some crazy moshpit over hidden money. Whether it is a winning lottery ticket in Malamaal Weekly, black money in Hera Pheri, \"kodokoo\" in Phir Hera Pheri, etc., etc., the director is becoming ridiculously predictable. Don't get me wrong; as clichÃ©d and preposterous his movies may be, I usually end up enjoying the comedy. However, in most his previous movies there has actually been some good humor, (Hungama and Hera Pheri being noteworthy ones). Now, the hilarity of his films is fading as he is using the same formula over and over again.<br /><br />Songs are good. Tanushree Datta looks awesome. Rajpal Yadav is irritating, and Tusshar is not a whole lot better. Kunal Khemu is OK, and Sharman Joshi is the best.\n"

In fact, at times, she physically looks a lot like the director, Liv Ullmann. However, rather inexplicably, she is swept away by a rogue. WHY she loves him exactly is never clear--it just seems like a case of infatuation. BUT, here's where the dumb part of the film occurs. First, despite there being little to base such a strong attraction on, Kirsten sleeps with the man and pledges her life to him--even after she finds out he already has a mistress (who, left her own husband to be with him). Then, despite finding out more and more and more awful things about the guy (he's a real pig), she steadfastly refuses to back away from him---hurting her parents and her fiancÃ© in the process. Think about it--a woman sacrifices everything for a man she barely knows and what so does know about him is really bad stuff!! I hate films about dumb people.<br /><br />By the way, IF the film had been the same up until she met the jerk and then fell in love with a WORTHY man, then this could have been a wonderful film about a young lady choosing an arranged marriage or listening to her own needs.

Except that, coincidentally, he happens to be the professors friend.

How incompetent a method of storytelling is that?<br /><br />In a work where it is used to serious effect we might tolerate the gross and extreme violence that begin with the very first frame ( a severed head ).

Besides, the film makers of today can't hold a candle to the film makers of yore. Small town scandal has been a topic for movies forever and a day, but none better than PEYTON PLACE. The acting is first rate, especially by DIANE VARSI; HOPE LANGE and LANA TURNER in the lead female roles. The male roles are a bit underdeveloped and LEE PHILLIPS seems a bit off as Michael Rossi. However, the more I see the film the more he grows on me, as does the entire film. The location sites are great as is the cinematography. The lush score by Franz Waxman really seals the films brilliance. This movie must be seen on the wide-screen with stereo sound for the full impact and appreciation. PEYTON PLACE clocks in at 2 hours and 37 mins., but could have been longer. The only distraction is the rear projection for Lana Turners exterior scenes.

              "  'text': \"There have been few entertainment franchises that have as successful and impressive as Batman. He is one of the most iconic comic book characters of all time and has thrived in almost every media source the series has adapted to. Of these extensions the most famous is the film adaptations. Tim Burton's Batman pushed the limits of what is considered to be children's entertainment and intense adult action and drama. Christopher Nolan reboot series has been equally influential, showing that a comic book film can take place in a realistic environment. However, one Batman series which is often overlooked in the character plunge into the animated world. Batman: The Animated Series is considered to be one of the best cartoons shows of all time and Batman: Mask of the Phantasm does for film what the cartoon show did for television, <br /><br />Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is able to fit two well developed stories into only 76 minutes. The first and primary plot focuses on Batman tracking down The Phantasm, a mysterious vigilante who has been systematically killing off mobsters while Batman is blamed. The second story focuses on the young fledgling crime fighter Bruce Wayne and how close he came to quitting in order to have a normal life with his love interest, Andrea Belmont.<br /><br />The movie begins with Batman breaking into a mob runs counterfeiting scheme, Batman deals with the henchman while the boss, Chuckie Sol, makes a beak for it. Before Batman can catch him he is murdered by the Phantasm. Batman is blamed for the killing and is forced to track down his imitator. Things grow more complicated as Andrea interest returns to Gotham City and Bruce believes that her father is somehow connected to the murders. This triggers Bruce's reminiscing about how his life would have been if he stayed with her. The film does a great job in juggling these to plots without ever being terribly predictable.<br /><br />The voice acting is equally admirable. Kevin Conroy's portrayal as Batman/Bruce Wayne is one of the most overlooked performances ever. He gives both Batman and Bruce Wayne different voices and speech patterns. He even makes the younger Bruce Wayne speak more energetically and innocently. The same can be said for Dana Delany who plays the young Andrea Belmont as naÃ¯ve and playful while the older version is more dark and isolated. The one performance that stands out, however, is The Joker, voiced by Mark Hamill. The Joker one has a few scenes but steals every shot that he is in, perfectly balancing the clown and the killer.<br /><br />However, as good as the story and acting is, it is the drawing style and animation the really stand out from the rest of the animated features. Unlike other animated films, Mask of the Phantasm focuses on a dark art deco design to show the vastness of Gotham City and to show the range of character emotions.<br /><br />The only negatives about the movie would be that the stories are very tight, which causes some scenes to feel rushed and less significant than it should, such as when Bruce first suits up as Batman. That and a few corny lines and clichÃ© morals really stick out from the high quality of the rest of the film. Still, Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is a terrific piece of entertainment that should not be skip by anyone that is a fan of Batman, animation, or film in general.\"},\n",

              "  'text': \"Too bad this dramatic powerhouse got lost in 1939's crowded field of movie classics because, as a drama, there was none better. Then too, the film appears an independent production released through United Artists, so it lacked crucial studio backing and all the attention that can bring. Also, producer-director Milestone clearly insisted on an unusual degree of realism in portraying life among California's migrant farm workers. And, let's face it, those conditions were pretty ugly, resulting in a pretty ugly setting from one scene to the next, never much of an audience incentive. For example, when the grieving Candy rolls onto his stomach following the execution of his faithful dog, we don't see the usual intact wardrobe. Instead, his shirttail is frayed and the Levi jacket split along the seam\\x97 a penniless old man who's now lost his only friend. Such dedication to detail may add to the realism, yet it can also depress an audience looking for what movies do best\\x97provide escape.<br /><br />But, of course, old Candy is not penniless. Instead, he's been saving his money, and now he has a nice little kitty saved, which raises one of the film's key themes\\x97a workingman's dream of independence. That's what brings the men together-- smart George, slow Lenny, old Candy, and even the racial outcast Crooks. All have spent their lives taking orders and making money for others, never having anything of their own. Yet, each harbors his own version of that dream\\x97a place where Lenny can pet rabbits, where Candy won't be abandoned, where Crooks can find human dignity, and where George can make it all work. And though the point goes unstated, the arrangement shapes up like a farm co-operative where everyone contributes and has a stake, an outcome certainly compatible with the spirit of the New Deal times.<br /><br />The other key theme is George's caring devotion for the slow-witted Lenny. He made a promise to do that, and, by golly, he's going to stick with it, even though he has to live with the often dire results. The screenplay starts with the two of them running from a posse. We learn that Lenny's desire to pet soft things has done something to a girl, but we don't learn exactly what. Yet George refuses to abandon the hulking Lenny, which, as things shape up, may be loyalty to a fault. The script makes clear that their companionship is rare among migrant workers, where the rule appears to be every man for himself. Thus Lenny and George together form a kind of a solidarity core that others can gravitate toward, should they want to. Thus arises the possibility of a co-op and the sense of community this would provide for lost souls such as Candy and Crooks.<br /><br />The trouble is that these two ideals\\x97dreams and loyalty\\x97collide in the screenplay to produce an upshot of uncommon emotional power. Lenny simply cannot control his kindly impulses, such that the hulking man's desire to caress can produce fear and panic in the other, causing Lenny to stop the panic in the only way he knows how\\x97by choking. Thus a desire to show affection ends in deadly violence from one more lost soul who, despite his fearsome appearance, only means well, all of which produces an irony of intense proportions. So when Lennie throttles the trollopy Mae after caressing her hair, events play out in tragic fashion. And the real nature of violence shatters the fragile nature of dreams.<br /><br />Now, I don't think anyone would blame George for his act of mercy, given the circumstances. However, there's an angle here that the emotion of the movie's last few minutes overpowers, and that is whether George's act of mercy does in fact represent the wisest or best decision, all things considered. After all, by honoring loyalty, George destroys the common dream of the four of them, thereby abandoning Crooks and Candy to an unpromising fate. As a result three men (including a likely incarcerated George) are victimized instead of one man, Lennie, being institutionalized, difficult though that would be. Again, I'm not saying George makes a blameworthy decision; in fact it comes across as a noble act of humane loyalty. I am saying there is more of an ethical conflict among the options open to George than may otherwise be recognized. A more general point is that the noble may at times conflict with the greater good, as it appears to here.<br /><br />The movie itself is very well done. Meredith is outstanding as George, hitting just the right pitch as a sensitive man in a complex world. Lennie is a darn difficult role, and while Chaney at times goes over the top, he does convey the essential childlike innocence. And because of that, the ending achieves much of its emotional power. Field looks the part of Mae, the cheap dame with dreams of Hollywood, but she's also stagey as heck, with one of the shrillest voices on record, such that It's almost a perverse relief when she gets throttled. Slim comes across as a rather mysterious character, and Bickford plays him with a compelling low-key dignity. The men obviously respect him, and he appears to be an authority they defer to, even George. But a question has stayed with me over time\\x97namely, why does Slim, a man who can see beyond the moment, approve the killing of Candy's old dog. He understands the devastating effect this will have on old Candy, who sees his own fate foreshadowed in the dog's. So why does Slim go along with Carlson's cruel demand. I've never been able to figure that one out.<br /><br />Anyway, I think producer-director Milestone has come up with a first-rate version of Steinbeck's classic novel. I'm just sorry this slice of blue-collar reality has gotten generally passed over by film historians. In my little book, it's clearly the best movie to come out of that so-called golden year 1939.\"},\n",

Among the omissions: Gleason\\'s film work (all the way back to the \\'40s and on to the year before his death), his first TV sitcom (\"The Life Of Riley\" was a 1949-50 Emmy winner!) and what happened to him between 1956 (when the last non-interview scene supposedly takes place) and his death 30 years later (!). Among the goofs: the wrong cue music (his most-used TV theme was also a hit single for him in 1953, \"Melancholy Serenade\"; after introducing his variety shows, Jackie\\'d leave the stage to the strains of \"That\\'s A-Plenty\", etc.) I was surprised to discover halfway through the film that he was still working the more-or-less small-time; too much screen time was devoted to his early years, which could have been greatly condensed. I also agree with another reviewer that the comedy monologues were uniformly terrible; one wonders why ANY of the audiences shown were laughing at all (except during the \"Honeymooners\" sequences). It\\'s unfortunate that the producers chose to present Gleason in such a relentlessly negative light. Maybe their view was, \"Hey, he\\'s dead. He can\\'t answer back and defend himself. He\\'s from another era than we are so who cares? Let\\'s just trash him.\" Gleason wouldn\\'t have had the career he did is he was really so hopelessly bad and untalented.

Marty Jannetty makes a valiant effort before succumbing to the innovative Power Plex and pin. Michaels leaves the arena on a stretcher, selling his leg injury like a wild man. 4/10 <br /><br />Texas Tornado v Mr Perfect for the Intercontinental title: Mr Perfect takes a few bumps before losing to the claw and Tornado Punch for an upset pin-fall. It was a nice WWF moment but it's sad to see Perfect lose without putting in the work-rate for a man of his potential. 5/10 <br /><br />Sapphire v 'Sensational' Sherri: Sapphire loses the match by forfeit because she doesn't make it to the ring. The WWF do a reasonable job at making it look legitimate. 0/10 <br /><br />Tito Santana v Warlord: Tito jobbed to one Powers of Pain at Wrestlemania, he may as well job to the other at Summerslam and he doesn't do a bad job of it. Tito tries for a monkey-flip but Warlord holds on to turnbuckles finishing Tito off with the power-slam and pin. 4/10 <br /><br />Hart Foundation v Demolition for the tag team titles in a 2-3 falls match: Demolition incorporated a new member called Crush to share the work load because Ax wasn't well and started a confusion angle (the only people confused where the officials as far as I was concerned) where Harts didn't know which two of the three they were getting. Interesting that Crush refer to Legion of Doom as 'second rate impostors' as Legion of Doom were the inspiration behind Demoliton. Crush and Smash start the match and get the first pin on Bret making it 1-0 to Demolition. The Foundation would soon come back after a terrible decision by Crush to take out the ref rather than Bret Hart who was pinning Smash - deliberate or rookie mistake? Shortly after the disqualification decision on Demolition (making it 1-1), Ax comes to the ring and hides under the apron and from there Smash switches sides so a fresh Ax comes into play. Legion of Doom come to the ring shortly after to serve justice to Demolition. Crush gets schoolboy pinned after taking a ringside slingshot from Niedhart making it 2-1 to The Hart Foundation to become new tag team champions. What I once considered a classic isn't as amazing in retrospect because The Foundation weren't fighting the original members. 7/10 <br /><br />Jake 'The Snake' Roberts v Bad News Brown - Bigbossman as special referee: Absolutely horrendous match as Bad News Brown gets disqualified for hitting Jake a second time in the stomach with a chair. This effort would be Bad News Brown's last match on PPV. 2/10 <br /><br />'Hacksaw' Jim Duggan and Nikolai Volkoff v Orient Express: It is very weird to see Nikolai Volkoff as a face but even more weird seeing him sing 'America the Beautiful' badly with Duggan before the match. The Orient Express get murdered by Duggan and Volkoff which ends in Duggan's 3 point stance clothesline and rare clean pin.3/10 <br /><br />Dusty Rhodes v 'Machoking' Randy Savage: The only point to the match was to show where Sapphire ended up - bought out by Ted Dibiase. The empty smile on Sapphire's face seemed very effective. This got poor Dusty distracted, ambushed and pinned after use of Sherri's loaded purse within a very short space of time. Dusty screaming for Sapphire after the match as she went off in Ted's limousine was quite an image. If Dusty had his way, Sapphire would have been a prostitute but WWF thought it unsuitable. If the WWF did go with Dusty's idea it would have made this plot angle so much more darker. 2/10 <br /><br />Hulk Hogan v Earthquake: I know there was build-up to this match but it certainly didn't deserve main event status. Were the WWF that worried if Hogan didn't main event their PPVs he would be forgotten about or was it Hogan's ego taking control at this point? The Hulkamania thing became stale from here as we enter another 'clash of the titans' type match featuring the typical Hogan can't slam big guy the first time but does the second time type thing. The difference between this match and other Hogan matches is that Earthquake loses by count-out after getting slammed on a table which is an awful booking decision. Like Hogan did with Randy Savage, he kept Warrior close so he would be guaranteed another title shot. 4/10<br /><br />Ultimate Warrior v 'Ravashing' Rick Rude for the World title in a steel cage: You can tell Rude was on the way out here because he referred to the crowd as 'Pennsylvanian Pissants' which caused a genuine stir. This match had shades of their previous encounter at the last Summerslam and was quite brutal as both were throwing each other into the cage from the start. I wasn't convinced that Rude would win the match after he went to the top of the cage following the 'Rude Awakening' neck breaker. He didn't look like he wanted to win, even missing an opportunity of going through the door while Warrior was tangling with Heenan. This would be Rude's last PPV match with the WWF. 6/10 <br /><br />Overall, I think the most disheartening realisation of Summerslam 1990 was that a lot of wrestlers at this point were on the way down, way out or underutilised and we would see the slow WWF career deaths of Dusty Rhodes and Demolition from this point on. Also I didn't realise how awful Roddy Piper was on commentary. I believe he was a 'Jesse Ventura replacement experiment' but it ended with bad results.\"},\n",

It shows a furry-headed, heavy-browed Hyde running into a house which is then set ablaze by a pursuing mob. Jekyll, now looking like a normal human, steps out of an upper story window and falls to his death.<br /><br />But (SPOILER!) thirty years later, his old friend Dr. Lanyon is revealed to have falsified Jekyll\\'s notes in a scheme to drive the Son of Dr. Jekyll mad, so Lanyon can steal the Jekyll estate...to replace his own fortune lost defending Jekyll Sr.<br /><br />Aside from the moral backflips Lanyon has to perform to go from valiant friend to chiseler and murderer, the movie never comes clean about who Mr. Hyde was. In order to make young Jekyll look insane, Lanyon fakes those notes and swaps \"Acrostyn\" for another chemical, so that Jekyll Jr. turns hairy and fanged - then faints - in the movie\\'s only transformation scene. It\\'s an odd medical breakthrough for Lanyon to have gone broke defending.<br /><br />Or is young Jekyll only hallucinating his transformation? Lanyon even boasts that he only needed mob hysteria to turn Edward Jekyll into a \"monster.\" But a hallucination would be an even bigger cheat - because the audience sees an actual transformation after Edward is unconscious.<br /><br />Then the closing crawl smugly notes that both Jekyll\\'s original notes and Lanyon\\'s forgery are archived at Scotland Yard as a solution to the Jekyll/Hyde myth. Huh?? When did it become a myth? Opening crawl, meet end credits! The movie does get props for reusing Mamoulian\\'s color-filter trick for revealing painted makeup in stages, devised for the Fredric March 1932 version. And Holmes Herbert from that film shows up here as a policeman. Lester Matthews (the hero of \"The Werewolf of London\") plays lawyer Utterson, a character from Stevenson\\'s novella usually omitted in screen adaptations. Alexander Knox, the model of rectictude as \"Wilson\", is wonderfully manipulative as Lanyon.<br /><br />Apparently, the idea was to make a monster movie with a minimum of expensive makeup sessions, and the script seems to have had numerous contradictory revisions. The production values are fairly threadbare, not many steps up from a 3 Stooges short of the era; at one point, Jekyll\\'s \"1890\" home is clearly a modern 1951 house with flagstone facing. But the studio cleverly reuses the big fire scene from the opening to close the picture with a bang.<br /><br />But that bang is still not loud enough to make you forget all the illogical and dishonest tricks the story plays on the viewer.'},\n",

Tracy was a master of film acting and never indulged in histrionics; however, when he spoke his words carried weight, and his figure had a presence that commanded attention. Mickey Rooney, on the other hand, could overplay a part, and his Whitey Marsh in the original \"Boys Town\" teeters perilously on being over the top. However, three years later, both Rooney and Whitey are more mature, and the characterization benefits. Rooney has toned down and deepened his performance, and, with more screen time, he holds his own with Tracy.<br /><br />The film\\'s plot is melodramatic and includes a crippled boy, a dog, a potential adoption, an escapee from a reform school, and financial problems, all of which, not surprisingly, resolve themselves in a flood of tears and smiles in the best tradition of old MGM movies. Bobs Watson returns as Pee Wee, and, although he should have outgrown the game with the candy in the drawers, he remains memorable for the waterworks that he could evidently turn on and off at the director\\'s command. Anne Revere, no slouch in the tears department herself, has a small memorable part near the film\\'s conclusion. Lee J. Cobb, who took over for Henry Hull as Dave Morris, Father Flanagan\\'s friend, is effective, although there is an initial jolt when he appears, because his is the only major role that was recast from the original film.<br /><br />The original \"Boys Town\" and this sequel must have drawn millions into the coffers of Father Flanagan\\'s home for boys.

The usual ingenuity was employed to stretch a small budget a long way, lots of British talent was available at micro-cost, a Hollywood A-lister came on board, it was based on probably the best of Dennis Wheatley\\'s black magic novels, and in an age when, thanks to THE EXORCIST, occult movies were in vogue, it might well have regenerated vital interest in the ailing studio.<br /><br />But it didn\\'t. Hammer folded shortly afterwards, and this movie contributed to that - even though it made a healthy profit. Nowadays it\\'s seen as something of a curiosity: a well-intentioned but belated addition to the Satanic horror cycle, still distinctly Hammer but laced with tasteless moments that don\\'t do anyone involved any credit at all, and at times so clumsily edited that you\\'re never really sure what\\'s going on. <br /><br />The first problem is the script, which apparently was being constantly rewritten right up until the end of production. As a result, there\\'s no clear narrative line for the audience to follow. What is the purpose of the hideously deformed baby? Is it the Devil incarnate? If so, why does it then get sacrificed? What\\'s Nastassja Kinski\\'s role in all this, apart from to lie alluringly on slabs and indulge in full-frontal nudity? Who are the lead-Satanist\\'s urbane followers? We never really get to know them, or understand what functions they have, and we see no real sign that they\\'re part of a larger cult. Why does one of them then bleed herself to death? Surely it isn\\'t required that every drop be drained from her body just so that a small amount can be trickled around a magic circle? Why, right at the end, are we suddenly introduced to the mysterious properties of flint-stone, and why, when it\\'s got the blood of one of Satan\\'s acolytes on it, will flint automatically protect the hero from demonic attack (if this is a part of arcane lore, how on Earth were we supposed to know \\x96 because the impression this movie gives is that we should be blown away by this revelation and say: \"Wow, why didn\\'t I see that coming?\")? <br /><br />The most perplexing moment of all however, comes \\x96 unforgivably \\x96 right at the climax of the movie. Once Christopher Lee has been thwarted, he simply disappears \\x96 with no explanation given. Has he escaped? Is he dead? Has the Devil taken him? We simply don\\'t know, we\\'re not told. (In actual fact, the answer is that in the original version, Lee was struck by lightning and died in flames, much the way he did in SCARS OF Dracula, and this similarity worried the producers so much that in the end it was simply cut out and not replaced.<br /><br />Another problem lies in what, ironically, should have been one of the movie\\'s greatest strengths \\x96 Richard Widmark. His presence (which was purely to justify US funding) is initially surprising and intriguing, but he was allegedly very difficult for the crew to work with, and extremely high and mighty while on set. And, despite that, he doesn\\'t give much of a performance. Stone-faced and unemotional throughout, he lacks any kind of charisma and is way too old to be the hero in a movie where 18-year-old Nastassja Kinski is the heroine. Kinski herself doesn\\'t add much, apart from the aforementioned risquÃ© moments, and this is a pity because the rest of the cast do a good job. Christopher Lee is at his most devilish as the excommunicated priest at the heart of the conspiracy, and is ably supported by Honor Blackman, Denholm Elliot and Anthony Valentine as innocents who get caught up in it. <br /><br />Director Peter Sykes does a reasonable job considering the difficulties he supposedly had, and composes some very nice shots \\x96 check out the opening sequence in the church, all played out under beautiful stained-glass reflections \\x96 and makes very good use of authentic locations in and around London and Munich. But all this really does is remind you what a good movie this could have been.<br /><br />New-fangled obscenity didn\\'t help it much either. Throughout the age of permissiveness, Hammer had been pushing the envelope with regard to sex. But it really cuts loose in this one. The Satanic orgies are the most explicit and realistic the studio ever produced, and in addition to these there\\'s a plethora of gratuitous female nudity, and then \\x96 yet again \\x96 we come to that ghastly, deformed baby. It seems to serve no purpose at all, and yet at one point is thrust up into Nastassja Kinski\\'s womb, and at another has its throat cut on camera while it\\'s still wriggling and crying. Christopher Lee was very unhappy with these scenes, while Dennis Wheatley was revolted and said afterwards that Hammer would never again adapt one of his stories \\x96 though neither Wheatley nor Hammer would live to see this defiance tested.<br /><br />The film is certainly good enough to watch again. The mysterious nature of the rituals involved is quite convincing \\x96 the symbols, the ancient books, the dusty vaults \\x96 but it\\'s too talkie and seems tediously slow by today\\'s standards and, as I said before, the finale is truly the most disappointing in Hammer history.'},\n",

The closing shot was taken from the clubhouse area, which was in back of centerfield. It's too bad all this happens at the very end of the picture.\"},\n",

              "  'text': \"I would like to say at the outset that even though I was disappointed that Cynthia Rothrock doesn't do more of her martial arts stuff in this film and I did think it a bit preposterous how indestructible Dakota Smith, played by Fred Williamson, appears to be, I enjoyed NIGHT VISION and am glad that it is a part of my DVD collection.<br /><br />I was surprised that Robert Prentiss, who plays the 'Video Stalker' bad guy wasn't listed further up in the credits (his name isn't in the opening credits) as his character is very prominent. Prentiss can be a bit of a cartoon villain at times in this film but is very convincing as a psycho. In the lead roles as a pair of disgraced cops trying to get their acts together, Williamson and Rothrock are very good. Support is given to them by the excellent Robert Forster, but unfortunately he doesn't have much to do in this picture. I was a bit sad to see Forster here actually. Although I do like NIGHT VISION, it is very much a 'B' movie and after Forster appeared in Quentin Tarantino's JACKIE BROWN a lot of people, me included, thought QT would resurrect Forster's career the same way he had done for John Travolta and Bruce Willis when they appeared in PULP FICTION. But Forster is brilliant any time he's on screen.<br /><br />The action is all handled brilliantly by Gil Bettman and the script by Michael Montgomery (who wrote another great overlooked action movie, EYE OF THE TIGER) has fantastic twists and turns in it. My only problem with the movie is actually the two jerk cops Bigelow and Johnson, who mock both our heroes. But at least they turn good in the end when they help the two nail the Video Stalker's crooked cop partner. I thought the black Dodge van which the Stalker travels in looks very menacing as well, and found it creepy how he seems to find out every intimate detail of his victims' lives. I think more could have been done with the plot line about the Stalker's mob connections, but overall, I rate NIGHT VISION as a brilliant action movie, and well worth spending 90 minutes of your life watching.\"},\n",

It's not that kind of film.<br /><br />I was anything but disappointed, but I knew what the film was all about before I saw it. Actually, what drew me to it was that I had read where this was a wonderful visual film, filled with rich colors and great set designs. It did not let me down. This is a great visual tribute to the 1940s, to be exact from 1938 to 1944. A real treat for the eyes.<br /><br />The story centers around a Jewish family in Queens and the importance that radio shows had in that day-and-age. Also profiled in here are some of those radio performers.<br /><br />It does have laughs but not as many as the normal Allen movie because the idea of this is simply to be a nostalgic piece, mainly Allen's tribute to his own family days of growing up, what it was like around his house.<br /><br />It was interesting to see Seth Green playing Woody as a youngster with flaming red hair. The most interesting person, however, was Diane Wiest who played a man-chasing sister-in-law. The film gives you a real flavor of the period, of New York and of a Jewish family.<br /><br />Overall, it's simply a nice film....and gorgeous to look at.

              "  'text': 'In the worst years of the depression, the most popular stars were not the most glamorous or attractive. As revealed in the highly respected Quigley poll (which surveyed movie theatre owners on who their audiences were most likely to come and see), the biggest draws in the early 30s were friendly, earthy types whom audiences could relate to at a time of poverty and desperation. These included genial comic Will Rogers, middle-aged frump Marie Dressler, and burly pug-face Wallace Beery, who played his greatest role in 1931 feature The Champ.<br /><br />Beery\\'s physique meant he was often cast as villainous thugs, but he had demonstrated enough acting prowess to get a decent number of \"gentle giant\" lead roles. In The Champ he gets to combine the two, one minute the swaggering pugilist, the next a devoted father. He gives a performance full of tiny gestures, expertly dancing from one expression to another. When he gets to show his character\\'s emotional vulnerability, the scene is doubly poignant coming after the macho confidence he normally displays. The knowledge that off the set Beery was reputedly a wife-beating brute who bullied everyone around him perhaps spoils the effect slightly, but even with this in mind his performance is captivating, believable and utterly flawless.<br /><br />Supporting Beery behind the camera is a director who was both a poet and a craftsman of the cinema \\x96 King Vidor. Vidor excelled at coaxing naturalism from his players at a time when theatrical hamming was the par. His camera focuses on Beery for long takes, allowing the actor to potter about doing his little bits of business and developing the character. Vidor also gives the picture bite with some neat tracking shots. These are usually in the field depth, so in other words we are either backing away from the actors or following them. The former kind, with the players advancing on the camera as in the shot that opens the picture, gives the characters presence and show them as a force to be reckoned with. The latter kind, where the camera follows the character, physically pulls us into their world. Vidor used these kinds of shot a lot, and they are a neat way of making the audience feel involved without drawing too much attention to the artificiality of the form.<br /><br />It may come as a surprise that this story of male bonding was written by a woman, Frances Marion. But like Beery, Marion defied expectations simply by being very good at what she did. Her plot for The Champ earned her the second of her two Oscars. It does not perhaps describe the most realistic of situations, but the emotional content is very sincere, and its depiction of determination and human feeling during hard times must have struck a chord with audiences of the day. The dialogue, which is credited to three separate people, is appropriately punchy with lines that sound believable yet are memorable and evocative.<br /><br />Aside from Beery, the rest of the cast are a good bunch. Of all the lead players, Irene Rich is the only one who doesn\\'t stand out, and she seems simply there to fill the wealthy, motherly type. But having said that she is not at all bad and her presence doesn\\'t harm the picture. The Champ also sees Roscoe Ates in one of his largest roles, and for once getting to appear as a normal person rather than the stuttering fool he was usually required to play. Finally there is Jackie Cooper, one of the greatest child stars of his or indeed any era. While it seems clear that fame has gone to the youngster\\'s head (he\\'s not quite as good as he thinks he is), he is certainly up to the task of carrying his end of the picture. He plays a genuine child when with Beery, but when he is around others he deepens his voice and adopts mannerisms as if trying to be an adult. It\\'s a touching and appropriate performance and very suited to the tone of the picture. And this was perhaps also the only time in which a child actor like Cooper could become a personality in his own right. As the popularity of Beery, Dressler et al proves, this was the age of the unconventional superstar.'},\n",

European nations and most South American nations freed their slaves without a civil war.

The plot of the would-be movie, also called \"The Dying Gaul,\" concerns a gay couple and what happens when one of them is faced with AIDS. It would make a perfect movie, so says the studio exec who wants to buy it and film it, except that the couple really doesn\\'t have to be gay. And it doesn\\'t really have to be called \"The Dying Gaul.\" And I guess it doesn\\'t really have to be about AIDS. And, when you get right down to it, the plot of this film itself doesn\\'t really have to be about Hollywood, screen writing, homosexuality, AIDS, infidelity or betrayal. But it has to be about something for it to be worth our time. And it isn\\'t.<br /><br />Strip away the pretentiousness of the supposed noble symbolism of \"the Dying Gaul,\" brush aside the trendiness of it being set in Hollywood, and forget the faux importance of it exploiting AIDS; and THE DYING GAUL is nothing but a gimmicky soap opera with a contrived and not-particularly-honest twist. It\\'s a love triangle wherein the anonymity of an internet chat room not only becomes a vehicle for deceit but the basis for a seemingly supernatural scam. Lovers and/or rivals building a wicked web of lies out of disguises is as old as drama, be the pretense coming in the form of masked balls, con games, mistaken identities, innocent pen pal letters or CB radios. Playing such duplicity for laughs, this sort of romantic misdirection can work nicely, but THE DYING GAUL has less in common with YOU\\'VE GOT MAIL than with the gloomy, pseudo-realism of overwrought junk like CLOSER.<br /><br />The neophyte screenwriter is Robert (Peter Sarsgaard), who wrote the script to honor his deceased partner, Malcolm. Jeffrey (Campbell Scott) is the producer who wants to make the movie, but insists that the sexuality of the protagonists is irrelevant; straight or gay, it is all the same, pain and loss is universal -- but straight pain and loss is more commercial. He should know, Jeff is bisexual and seems more interested in Robert\\'s sword than his pen. But Jeff loves his wife, Elaine (Patricia Clarkson), who becomes fast friends with Robert, until she figures out that the two guys are collaborating in more ways than one. So far, so good. Then writer/director Craig Lucas derails his entire project by letting his entire film become hijacked by a lame and contrived gimmick. Elaine, using a fake identity, begins exchanging messages with Robert via the internet and convinces the already disturbed writer that he is actually communicating with the spirit of his dead lover. Apparently DSL reaches as far as Heaven\\'s gate.<br /><br />Even as the film prattles on about mythic themes and makes references to famed art and literature, yet sells out to a lame technological gimmick, it still has potential. Elaine suddenly has the power to control Robert and, indirectly, her husband. But Elaine doesn\\'t know what to do with her newfound power, and unfortunately neither does Lucas. The confused story takes a dark turn and it is obviously headed for tragedy, but Lucas balks at making the film either an outright thriller or even a psychologically twisted comedy. He has a cast of morally bankrupt characters (well acted by excellent actors), but he seems unwilling to let any of them be the villain. Each are painted as being capable of killing, but when death finally takes a role in the story it is left frustrating unclear whether a murder was even committed. The ambiguity is meant to be clever or disturbing or shocking, but it is really just a sign of incredibly bad writing.<br /><br />The film certainly doesn\\'t play to our expectations. Lucas is an acclaimed gay playwright and is probably best known for his script for LONGTIME COMPANION, a landmark in gay cinema. So when the film at first appears to be about the integrity of gay fiction -- compromising orientation and honesty to pander to a straight public -- there is a promise of THE DYING GAUL being a story of substance. But that quickly evaporates when the ineffectual Robert far too easily sells out his values -- literary and sexual -- to the charming and pragmatic bisexual Jeffrey. Then there is the hope that the film will be about redemption, about Robert regaining his self-respect and ethics -- but that never materializes and if anything the characters grow increasingly amoral -- and increasingly less interesting.<br /><br />Ultimately, the story seems intent on proving Jeffrey right, that the sexuality of the protagonists is irrelevant; straight or gay, it is all the same, good and evil are hardly relevant. And, I suppose, there is some minor victory to be had by Lucas showing no need to be politically correct by making Robert neither a role model nor a tragic hero -- but just another unredeemable human wretch. But the victory is very small and no more meaningful or gratifying than Robert\\'s ultimate reward.<br /><br />And for what is worth, Jeffrey is right; THE DYING GAUL is a lousy title.'},\n",

Glossy melodrama directed by Mark Robson allows star Lana Turner to suffer nobly, playing single mother to graduating teenager Diane Varsi, harboring a skeleton in her family closet while being romanced by high school principal Lee Philips (in an appealing performance). Varsi and her friends are all awakening to the joys of boy-girl coupling, unsure about sex and not about to ask their parents for help. Involving and polished, though just a bit stiff or starchy. The courtroom climax (with shopgirl Hope Lange on trial for killing her abusive step-father) is really corny, but fans of the soap genre will be enthralled.

He awakes in what appears to be a heavenly place, and much to his surprise he is visited by a deity, and told that he is on probation, he is in short...almost an angel.<br /><br />Paul Hogan will forever be known as the bloke from Crocodile Dundee, a highly efficient fish out of water comedy that became a huge hit, the sequels and his other subsequent films are either roundly ignored or highly frowned upon. That's a shame because Almost An Angel is a very engaging comedy, the sort of picture that stands up like a Capraesque piece for the 90s. It's the sort of fable that cheers one up when the blues draw in and then turn into a blackly dark cloud, yes it be true, old craggy faced Paul Hogan has the gift of comedy. Yes the doses of sentiment are at times like a treacle itch to be scratched, but is that a bad thing?, watching a street wise criminal turning his less than honourable skills into a thing of goodness?.<br /><br />The film has many visual gags to go with the ream of religious ones that flow within the piece, be it Hogan attempting to fly or a quiet word about Elvis, Almost An Angel delights if one accepts the nature of the beast. Linda Kozlowski again teams up with Hogan {after the earlier Crocodile Dundee pairing}, here she has very little to do but she slots in very nicely, even if a pre-end credits sequence does her and everyone else no favours at all. The best actor on show is the criminally undervalued Elias Koteas, playing the wheelchair bound Steve Garner, he exudes a believability factor that many modern day actors can learn from, the ability to act with just your face is high art if it's done correctly. Check out both the first and last scenes that Koteas shares with Hogan, great stuff that seems to have been forgotten due to disdain shown for this particular film.<br /><br />I rate it 7/10 because it hits my spot when i need a pick me up, perhaps that is too high in this age where comedy is the hardest genre to succeed in, but don't believe the low rating here on this site, it's a delightful little comedy that is far from perfect, but hell!, it's a heavenly piece knowingly incorporating the serious side of religious belief.\"},\n",

              "  'text': 'Talking about bad Hitchcock films is kind of fun given Sir Alfred didn\\'t make many of them, just enough to show himself human. And as bad Hitchcock movies go, \"Jamaica Inn\" is moderately more entertaining than others like \"Number 17,\" \"The Paradine Case,\" and \"Topaz,\" though for the same reason it is so awful: Charles Laughton.<br /><br />Laughton plays Sir Humphrey Pengallan, lord of a coastal Cornish fiefdom that includes Jamaica Inn, a den of cutthroats to which journeys young Mary (Maureen O\\'Hara), niece of the innkeeper\\'s wife. After rescuing one of the gang from hanging, Mary finds herself seeking Sir Humphrey\\'s mercy. But just how merciful is his lordship? Not very, if all the scenery we see him chewing in his opening vignette is any indication, muttering airily about the lack of true beauty in the world and having as the guest of honor at a fancy dinner party his prize horse. The Caligula touch is apropos of Sir Humphrey as we get to know him, and of Laughton, too, as he takes every line in the script as a license for excess.<br /><br />Laughton held the overall reins of this project as his pet producer was in place over Hitchcock, and you can see how he was granted free roam whether Hitch cared or no. Most actors playing characters with dual identities are content with one revelation scene; Laughton must have three. Every other line of his is delivered in extreme close-up, twitching an outrageously fake pair of eyebrows and stepping on lines by the other actors like they were ants at a picnic.<br /><br />\"Next thing you\\'ll be telling me you\\'re as good as I am,\" he sniffs, beetle brows popping at a hapless extra, upper lip puffed as if full of Skoal. \"You\\'re not as good as me. Nature was against you from the start; everything else has been against you since.\"<br /><br />Hitchcock didn\\'t make many period pieces in his career, so the fact that this one is set in Regency England circa 1819 is a source of some positive anticipation, as is O\\'Hara making her screen debut. Original author Daphne Du Maurier gave Hitchcock the source material for two of his most well-regarded films, \"Rebecca\" and \"The Birds.\" Laughton and Hitchcock possessed the same mordant wit, an eye for taking the mickey out of a highly-charged scene.<br /><br />Yet none of it comes off here. O\\'Hara is shrill and wimpy, crying \"Aunt Patience, Aunt Patience\" every five minutes and taxing our patience continually. The rest of the cast, led by Robert Newton as Mary\\'s hamster-cheeked companion, is uniformly bad, especially Leslie Banks as the overbearing innkeeper and Marie Ney as Patience his wife, always looking right at the camera as she does her Tammy Wynette thing in explaining to Mary the merits of her Springer-worthy marriage. Instead of a coherent storyline, one stares at a screen dark as an oil slick from which various dime-novel tropes occasionally squeak out. Some like web reviewer Self-Styled Siren see this as intentional comedy; with all respect to her Bloggeress I must disagree. There is no sign of irony here, just a lot of clinkers.<br /><br />The only redeeming virtue in \"Jamaica Inn\" is the same thing that makes it worse than other Hitch flops like \"Topaz\": Laughton\\'s overripe performance. He\\'s so over-the-top and without restraint that he\\'s often hilarious. I don\\'t flatter myself to think I can look down on Laughton; at his best he was quite a brilliant actor. But here is a case of a talent in losing battle against his own formidable ego, playing every scene with a flip hauteur that seems to mock anyone else\\'s attempt to be engaged.<br /><br />That unfortunately included Hitchcock himself, as can be seen from the way scenes trail off or start suddenly, completely lacking the Master\\'s usual polish. He had other worlds to conquer by this time, preparing to embark on his most fruitful patch of work by sailing to the United States. Too bad he left England on such a bum note.'},\n",

Acting is fine, although dialogue is shouted more than spoke, and delivered with all the subtlety of a flanged mace.

Meanwhile, it\\'s no surprise that Hackman gives us another fascinating performance, this time as the attorney\\'s brutally racist grandfather, \"Sam Cayhall.\" He\\'s been imprisoned for a murder and O\\'Donnell is trying to release him from a death sentence. Hackman\\'s performance elevates from a \"fair\" to a \"good\" movie. While O\\'Donnell is trying to do his job, a few revelations occur considering his Klansman grandpa. Faye Dunaway also is in here and has a memorable scene with \"Sam.\"<br /><br />Yes, the critics were right in that this could have been better but they were off base blasting this film. It\\'s still an entertaining film, and they forget the value of that.'},\n",

              "  'text': 'Chuck Lumley (Henry Winkler) is a harried, put-upon nerd who gave up a prominent career on Wall Street because it was making him a nervous wreck. Now he works a peaceful, low stress job at the city morgue - but things change when he\\'s forced into working the night shift.<br /><br />He\\'s partnered with Bill Blazejowski (Michael Keaton, in an instant attention-getting debut film performance), a wild and offbeat \"idea man\" who likes to carry around a tape recorder so he can record his crackpot ideas - example, feeding mayonnaise to tuna-fish.<br /><br />He also makes the acquaintance of Belinda Keaton (Shelley Long), a \"nice girl\" prostitute who\\'s just moved into his building. She reveals to him that she and her friends are in need of a pimp since their last one was murdered.<br /><br />Well, Bill gets the bright idea that he and Chuck should be pimps for Belinda and her friends and that they should operate out of the morgue (Bill\\'s already enough of an entrepreneur to rent out the hearse as a limo for horny college kids).<br /><br />What follows next is truly one of the brightest and funniest - and actually endearing - comedies to emerge from the 1980\\'s.<br /><br />This is no mean trick. I mean, making an upbeat, easygoing (yet still R-rated) comedy about prostitution would seem like a crazy thing to do. Yet, screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (that is the craziest stage name I\\'ve ever heard!) mine all situations for their humor and heart.<br /><br />Most of the mileage comes out of Keaton\\'s comic energy - and whenever this picture starts to drag, he can be counted on to bring back some life into the thing.<br /><br />Chuck is a sweet, simple guy who I actually like - the complete antithesis of The Fonz - and it turns out to have been one of Winkler\\'s best performances ever, guided well by his old \\'Happy Days\\' cohort Ron Howard (who has a cameo as the annoying saxophone player).<br /><br />Even Shelley Long is really, really sweet, delivering one of her more notable feature film performances.<br /><br />LOTS of familiar faces in the supporting cast, and these include Gina Hecht, Pat Corley, Vincent Schiavelli, Charles Fleischer, Richard Belzer, Joe Spinell, Howard\\'s cult icon brother Clint, and others. Be on the lookout for Kevin Costner (I sure had a hard time spotting him!) as a frat boy, Shannen Doherty as a Bluebell, and Drew Barrymore\\'s mom Jaid as one of the prostitutes.<br /><br />Film introduces the song \\'That\\'s What Friends Are For\\', sung and produced by Rod Stewart. A few years later, it would be a hit for Dionne Warwick and Friends.<br /><br />\"Night Shift\" is entertaining and likable and that\\'s pretty much all that matters.<br /><br />Just a couple of good lines to pique your interest:<br /><br />\"Oh, that Barney Rubble...what an actor!\"<br /><br />\"Hello, this is Chuck to remind Bill to SHUT UP!\"<br /><br />\"LOOOOOOOOVE BROKERS!\"<br /><br />\"Note to self...call Starkist.\"<br /><br />7/10'},\n",

That show starred Bret Harrison as Sam - the youngest exec at an airline.<br /><br />Bret was the MAN on The Loop so of course I followed him over to Reaper where he plays another character named Sam but this one's a college dropout who works at a Home Depot clone. Sam turns 21 and suddenly he finds out that his parents has sold his soul to The Devil many, many years ago. The Devil (Ray Wise) comes to collect by making Sam become the 'devil's bounty hunter' by re-reaping souls that have escaped from Hell and now are killing people back on Earth. It's really a win-win...the devil gets his soul back and the town has less murders. Sam, however, thinks the situation ...well...SUCKS! The show is pure genius. It is set up like Smallville or Buffy where there's a 'monster of the week' to beat up but here it is always secondary to Sam just trying to live his life normally. He has two friends which are INCREDIBLE: Sock (Tyler Labine) who is the overweight, quick witted buddy that everyone prays they have in their life and Ben (Rick Gonzalez) who rounds out the trio and usually is the one who ends up getting hurt...quite hysterically. It's a show about GREAT FRIENDSHIP and this show has it...you really believe these guys are friends. The show is rounded out with super hottie Andi (Missy Peregrym) who likes Sam but isn't in 'the know' of what's up with him and is therefore blown off a lot and the BRILLIANT Ted (Donovan Stinson) who is the young arrogant jerkie boss who is more akin to be a young David Brent from the office - he wants to be cool...but he's the boss.<br /><br />The show SHINES with Harrison and gives 'Devil' Ray Wise the biggest and best performance of his career. The man shines in every single scene he has on the show. You see him as he tries to help Sam and when he is angry that smile disappears in a moment and you truly believe that there is Satan behind Ray Wise's eyes.<br /><br />A top notch cast, amazing scripts, great direction...I was sad to see The Loop get cancelled and now I wouldn't have it any other way. Reaper is brilliant and I only hope it lasts for many seasons to come.<br /><br />Ryan McLelland Latino Review/Newsarama\"},\n",

He finds utter contempt from the people living there as he fought on the side of the north. What else should he expect- a ticker-tape parade?<br /><br />Van Heflin is our turncoat and along the way, having survived Vicksburg, he has gotten religion and plans to be a preacher.<br /><br />The heavy in the film is none other than Raymond Burr who does everything in his power to thwart the goals of Luke Fargo (Heflin) even if it means burning down the church or spreading horrendous gossip about Heflin and his sudden 18 year old charge, Lissy, played nicely by Woodward. Throughout the film,she appeared to be a tom-boy like character, who Heflin tries to tame.<br /><br />The problem with the film is that every time Burr strikes at Heflin, there is really no excitement. Even at the end, Burr just drives his horse and buggy away. A Gunfight At The OK Corral like ending was needed here.\"},\n",

He wasn't quite convincing about having a southern accent, a glitch that was slightly distracting to the otherwise intense scenes he appeared in.<br /><br />Otherwise every part in this movie was played to perfection, especially by Crowe and Pacino. A very believable effort by Christopher Plummer as the venerable Mike Wallace, and all the other supporting roles tell a story of truth, morality, and justice in a way that surpasses the run-of-the-mill Hollywood flick.<br /><br />A great movie, one of the best, that would be great even if there were no truth to it.\"},\n",

In fact my only complaint, but it's a major one in my book, reside in the image quality of this film. As far as I understand, this film was shot on mini-DV and, unfortunately, it shows. There's a serious lack of definition and, most of the time, the image is very noisy! Hopefully it will look better whenever it comes out on DVD but, on a giant screen in a theater, it doesn't come out very good. Take in note that I work in the industry as a quality control technician, so my opinion on this matter could be a little strong compare to most people. As a matter of fact a friend of mine was present during this showing and told me that she didn't even notice that it was shot on mini-DV so... :) Beside that factor I really enjoyed this film and I strongly recommend it!\"},\n",

However, it seems to me that you must judge it by what it seeks to achieve. It is not an ambitious movie in any sense and against that background I think it succeeds quite well. Both Iben Hjejle (her in particular) and Anders Berthelsen give very convincing performances and very much carry the film. This is the sort of film that makes you feel good without the shallowness and emptiness that so often mar the typical 'Feel-good' Hollywood production.

Some story lines may be a little out their like the Salem stalker but most story lines have meaning to them like the Dimera/Brady feud to show real meaning of hatred. Even though sometimes the same storyline can drag on and on and yes it is a bit annoying but it makes you keep on watching and sometimes sitting on the edge of your seat. Days of our lives is something that was not made in one day all episode's of days in my opinion must take hard work and I find every single actor and actress is amazing. Days of our lives get a 10 in my opinion for amazing acting; creative story lines & amazing connections with are world and a different world.
